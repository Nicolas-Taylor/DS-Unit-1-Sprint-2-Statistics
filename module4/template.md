# Assignment!

Then compare and contrast and select one as the idea you're leaning towards
working on for your project week.


# Ideas for data storytelling - Idea 1

## You

What do you care about? Movies


What do you know about? Movies that Samuel L. Jackson has been in


What decisions do you face? Where to look, what movies to choose, what's classified as a swear word


## Seven templates

Training Kit (https://learn.lambdaschool.com/ds/module/recedjanlbpqxic2r) explains the seven templates from Priceonomics.

Can you apply the templates to your topics? 

1. Geographic Variation. N/A


2. Trend related to the news. N/A


3. Who does that? People who are interested to see how many times Sam has sworn in movie


4. Answering a question people care about. What's swear word does he say the most, what movie has the most swearing in


5. Valuable to businesses. I don't think so


6. What's the most popular? What word is most said and what word is said the least


7. Cost/Money rankings. N/A


## Misconceptions

What misconceptions do people have about your topic? I don't think people have any, I'm fairly certain that pretty much everyone knows he swears a lot


## Examples

What data storytelling example inspires you? Who is the main side character in The Simpsons


Could you do a new hypothesis, for the same question? I think so


Could you do a new question, for the same topic? I don't think so


Could you do a new topic, with the same "style"? Yea of course


## Data

Where could you search for data about your topic? Looking at movie script online or just watching the movies

# Ideas for data storytelling - Idea 2

## You

What do you care about? The mobile tower defense type game Random Dice


What do you know about? You can choose five different dice and by combining them you see how long you can survive for, or try to last longer than your opponent 


What decisions do you face? Which dice are the best, which dice are the worst, which combinations work the best, should you prioritize single or group targeting dice


## Seven templates

Training Kit (https://learn.lambdaschool.com/ds/module/recedjanlbpqxic2r) explains the seven templates from Priceonomics.

Can you apply the templates to your topics? 

1. Geographic Variation. N/A


2. Trend related to the news. Mobile games are pretty popular, and almost everyone has some sort of game on their phones


3. Who does that? People that want to get better at the game


4. Answering a question people care about. Which five dice will help you last longer than anyone else


5. Valuable to businesses. I don't think so


6. What's the most popular? Certain dice, whether to use dice that hurt your opponent or dice that benefit you


7. Cost/Money rankings. Everything in the game you can obtain by just playing, and it's super easy, but there are in app purchases to get more in-game currency


## Misconceptions

What misconceptions do people have about your topic? That certain dice are better than other, when mostly it really depends on which dice you have them paired with


## Examples

What data storytelling example inspires you? The Hearthstone data my TL told me about


Could you do a new hypothesis, for the same question?  Yea


Could you do a new question, for the same topic? Yea


Could you do a new topic, with the same "style"? Yep


## Data

Where could you search for data about your topic? Playing the games myself and writing down: how long the game lasted, what dice I used, which dice seemed the most useful to me, what dice the top players are using, etc.
